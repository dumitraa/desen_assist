about=DesenAssist is a QGIS 3 plugin built for a private company internal team to accelerate digitization and quality‑control of low‑voltage underground utility poles and related network features. While the code is public‑facing, it assumes our layer names, field schema and corporate‑wide conventions, so mileage outside the company may vary.
